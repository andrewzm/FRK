\title{Covariance tapering based on distances.}
\usage{
.cov_tap(D_matrices, taper = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{D_matrices}{A list of distance matrices corresponding to each resolution.}

\item{taper}{The strength of the taper (either a vector or a single number).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{beta}{A vector of taper parameters.}
  \item{nnz}{A vector containing the number of non-zeros in each block of the 
  tapered prior covariance matrix, K_tap.}
  \item{D_tap}{A sparse block-diagonal matrix containing the distances with 
  some distances set to zero post tapering. }
}
}
\description{
Computes the covariance tapering parameters \eqn{\beta} (which are dependent
on resolution), number of non-zeros in each block of the tapered
covariance matrix K_tap, and the tapered distance matrix whereby some distances
have been set to zero post tapering (although the remaining non-zero distances 
are unchanged).
}
\details{
\code{taper} determines how strong the covariance tapering is; the ith taper parameter
\eqn{\beta_i} is equal to \code{taper[i]} * \code{minDist[i]}, where
\code{minDist[i]} is the minimum distance between basis functions at the
\code{i}th resolution.
