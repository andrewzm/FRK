Description: Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling and prediction with large datasets. The approach decomposes the field, and hence the covariance function, using a fixed set of r basis functions, where r is typically much smaller than the number of data points (or polygons) m. This low-rank basis-function representation facilitates the modelling of 'big' spatial/spatio-temporal data. The method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions. Discretisation of the spatial domain into so-called basic areal units (BAUs) facilitates the use of observations with varying support (i.e., both point-referenced and areal supports, potentially simultaneously), and prediction over arbitrary user-specified regions. The package `FRK` caters for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, employing a spatial generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework  to cater for Poisson, binomial, negative-binomial, gamma, and inverse-Gaussian distributed data. `FRK` also supports inference over various manifolds, including the 2D plane and 3D sphere, and it provides helper functions to model, fit, predict, and plot with relative ease. Zammit-Mangion and Cressie <arXiv:1705.08105> describe `FRK` in a Gaussian setting, and detail it's use of basis functions and BAUs.
