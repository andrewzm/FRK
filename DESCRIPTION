Description: Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling
    and prediction with large datasets. The approach, discussed in Cressie and
    Johannesson (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00633.x>, decomposes the 
    spatial/spatio-temporal field, and hence the covariance function, using a f
    ixed set of r basis functions, where r is typically much smaller than the 
    number of data points (or polygons) m. 
    The method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions 
    and the use of observations with varying support (with known error variance).  
    The package FRK provides helper functions to model, fit, and predict using 
    the fixed-rank kriging approach with relative ease, using both Gaussian 
    and non-Gaussian data.
